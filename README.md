# Iva's Art RAG Pipeline
A demo RAG chatbot pipeline using the wikiart-subjects dataset.

The Jupyter notebook contains many additional notes.

# UPDATE: Exported personal notes
I have now included the notes I took for my own reference while working on this coding challenge.
If I had more time, Iâ€™d intended to move at least some of it (such as the Future Directions doc) into a nascent GitHub wiki for the project, but got a little too carried away noodling with FAISS.
